# AI-CHATBOT
A customer support chatbot project focusing on context awareness, sentiment analysis, and machine learning–based intent detection.
# AI Chatbot for Customer Support

## Overview
This project focuses on building and incrementally improving a customer support chatbot.
The chatbot addresses common limitations of traditional chatbots such as irrelevant responses,
lack of conversational context, and poor handling of user emotions.

## Problem Statement
Customers often experience dissatisfaction with customer support chatbots due to
context-insensitive replies, repetitive responses, and failure to recognize user frustration.
This project aims to study these limitations and improve chatbot behavior using
context-aware logic and machine learning techniques.

## Current Features
- Rule-based customer support chatbot
- Intent detection using keyword matching
- Basic sentiment detection (positive / neutral / negative)
- Empathetic responses for dissatisfied users
- Continuous conversation loop (terminal-based)

## Current Limitations
- Limited conversational context memory
- Keyword-based intent detection is fragile
- Follow-up queries may be misunderstood

## Planned Enhancements
- Context-aware multi-turn conversation handling
- Machine learning–based intent classification
- Machine learning–based sentiment analysis
- Improved response relevance and escalation logic

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Rule-based NLP
- (Planned) Scikit-learn for ML models

## Status
Project is under active development as part of an academic research project.
